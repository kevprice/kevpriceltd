            <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 12, 2026</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Kev Price Ltd, Company No. 16904235 ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our Discord bots and services ("Services").</p>

            <h2>1. Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
            <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and collecting only the minimum amount of data necessary to operate our Services. Our Services process limited personal data, such as Discord user and server identifiers, solely for functional and operational purposes.</p>

            <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
            
            <h3>2.1 Pseudonymous Identifiers</h3>
            <p>We store limited technical identifiers, such as Discord user or server IDs. These identifiers may be hashed or otherwise pseudonymised to reduce direct identifiability. Such data remains personal data under applicable data protection laws and is processed solely to operate and maintain the Services.</p>
            <p>These measures reduce the risk of direct identification but do not fully anonymise the data.</p>
            <p>These identifiers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Are used solely to identify unique users for service functionality</li>
                <li>Support secure and reliable operation of the Services</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Discord Data</h3>

                <li>Server settings and configurations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This information is processed in real-time to provide bot functionality and is not stored permanently unless necessary for the bot's operation.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Usage Data</h3>

                <li>Error logs for debugging purposes</li>
